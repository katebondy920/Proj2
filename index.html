              What Happened
            </h2>
            <hr>
            <h8 class="post-subtitle">
              <p>Back in November of 2019, LVMH, a luxury brand parent company, announced that it would make a historic and ground breaking $16.2 billion purchase of the American icon, Tiffany & Co.. Then, as we all know the pandemic hit. While most companies found ways to survive the pandemic, LVMH claims that Tiffany's neglected their company knowing that they were selling. So, are they justified in backing out of the deal? Can the data tell us the story?</p>

            How Did Tiffany's Become an American Icon
            </h2>
            <hr>
            <h8 class="post-subtitle">
              <p> When Tiffany & Co. fist opened in 1837, it was primarily a fine goods and stationary store. The Gilded age helped secure there place in the luxury world. Tiffany's was able to prove it's place in the high end market by using the 92% pure silver British Standard method for creating it's ornate silver products.</p>
  <p>Tiffany's would later secure it's place in the luxury market jewlery market by introducing the concept of the diamond engagement ring we now all know (and expect!). Tiffany's soon began selling perfume's and other luxury items expanding there market.</p>
  <p>Tifanny & Co.'s role as a cultural icon was secured futher with it's place in movies such as Breakfast at Tiffany's and Rosemary's Baby. Tiffany's is now a common household name, and one that LVMH wanted as one of there brands.</p>

            What is LVMH?
            </h2>
            <hr>
            <h8 class="post-subtitle">
              <p>LVMH, which stands for Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy, is a French multinational corporation and conglomerate that specializes in luxury goods. Since the merging of these three companies, LVMH has now taken over 75 copmanies under its fold, including Bulgari, Givenchy, Fendi, Princess Yachts, and Dior.</p>
              <p>The company is now owned and operted by Bernard Arnault who is the fourth richest person in the world with a net worth of $80.3 billion. Prior to the pandemic he was the second richest and in a race with Jeff Bezos.</p>
              <p>LVMH deals mostly in the clothing, cosmetics, fashion, accessories, jewlery, perfume, spritis, watche and wine industries. With their large number of worldwide high end jerwlery companies, they have struggled in the past with obtaining an Americna jewlery icon. While Bulgari, thier leading jewlery company, is a cornerstone of mayne foregin luxury markets, it pales in copmarison to Tiffany's when it comes to the United States. So this acquitstion was a huge deal for LVMH.</p>
